This artifact corresponds to the paper entitled "A Low-Latency High-Order Arithmetic to Boolean Masking Conversion".

The artifact includes our proposed CSA-based A2B (Algorithm 7) and, for comparison, RCA-based A2B ([BC22] in Table 1\~3) and KSA-based A2B ([CGTV15] in Table 1\~3). The software implementations are in the ./SW/convab.c, while the hardware implementations are in the ./HW/rtl directory.
